# eminem-flow-detector
code that if it finds the words "Eminem" or the name of one of his songs, it throws an error. code that if it finds the words "Eminem" or the name of one of his songs, it throws an error. Throw this file into the modules folder, import it and write "eminem_detector.activate()" so that the "Eminem-detector" works in your code. It was created for fun, lol
P.S. insert the command "eminem_detector.activate()" at the very end of the code, otherwise the program will freeze and will not respond to anything, even to KeyboardInterrupt, I don't know why
